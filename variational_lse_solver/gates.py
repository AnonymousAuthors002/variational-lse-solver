    Apply a parameterized Pauli-X gate to the specified wires.

    The parameterized Pauli-X gate is implemented as a Hadamard gate followed by
    a parameterized Pauli-Z gate and another Hadamard gate. The parameterized Pauli-Z
    gate is controlled by the 'value' argument, which determines the rotation around
    the Z-axis. For a value of 0 or 1, the Pauli-X operation corresponds to the identity
    or the Pauli-X gate, respectively.

    Apply a parameterized Pauli-Y gate to the specified wires.

    The parameterized Pauli-Y gate is implemented by applying a parameterized S gate,
    followed by a parameterized Pauli-X gate, and finally a parameterized S-dagger (Sdg) gate.
    The 'value' argument controls the parameter for the S and Sdg gates, which in turn control
    the rotation around the Z-axis. This sequence of operations results in a rotation around
    the Y-axis, effectively implementing the parameterized Pauli-Y gate.

    Apply a parameterized Pauli-Z gate to the specified wires.

    The parameterized Pauli-Z gate is implemented using a phase shift operation (U1)
    controlled by the 'value' argument. The phase shift is equivalent to a rotation
    around the Z-axis on the Bloch sphere. For a value of 0, the gate is the identity;
    for a value of 1, it corresponds to the Pauli-Z gate.
